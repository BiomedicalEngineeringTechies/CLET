# CLET
Computation of Latencies in Event-related potential Triggers is a semi-automated method to accurately compute the latencies (i.e., time delay) between triggers (or markers) used in EEG/ERP experiments. 

This repository currently includes supplementary tables and codes (CLET_LEDscreen.m , CLET_VR.m , latencydist.m) of the manuscript titled 'CLET: Computation of Latencies in Event-related potential Triggers using photodiode on virtual reality apparatuses'. Example data is publically available in Research Gate DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.16353.28008 .

The spreadsheets include results using the CLET codes. In all the spreadsheets, the first column lists the Onset time of the triggers sent (in s), the second column lists the Onset time of the triggers detected using the photodiode (in s), and the third column lists the latency between triggers detected and triggers sent (in ms) with the average latency Â± standard deviation mentioned in the last cell of the third column.
