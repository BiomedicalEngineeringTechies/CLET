Computation of Latencies in Event-related potential Triggers.

This repository currently includes supplementary figures and tables of the manuscript titled 'CLET: Computation of Latencies in Event-related potential Triggers using photodiode on virtual reality apparatuses'.

The pdf file named 'CLET_SupplementryFigures' consists of two figures. Fig 1S describe the procedure to place and cover the photodiode on both the displays. Fig 2S show the photodiode data recorded from each of the displays.

The spreadsheets included results using the CLET codes. In all the spreadsheets, the first column list the Onset time of the triggers sent (in s), the second column list the Onset time of the triggers detected using the photodiode (in s), and the third column list the latency between triggers detected and triggers sent (in ms) with the average latency Â± standard deviation mentioned in the last cell of the third column.  

NOTE: CLET codes, datasets and a tutorial video to use the codes will uploaded after the acceptance of the manuscript.
