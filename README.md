# CLET
Computation of Latencies in Event-related potential Triggers is a semi-automated method to accurately compute the latencies (i.e., time delay) between triggers (or markers) used in EEG/ERP experiments. 

This repository currently includes supplementary tables of the manuscript titled 'CLET: Computation of Latencies in Event-related potential Triggers using photodiode on virtual reality apparatuses'.

The spreadsheets include results using the CLET codes. In all the spreadsheets, the first column list the Onset time of the triggers sent (in s), the second column list the Onset time of the triggers detected using the photodiode (in s), and the third column list the latency between triggers detected and triggers sent (in ms) with the average latency Â± standard deviation mentioned in the last cell of the third column.  

Please NOTE: CLET codes, datasets, and a tutorial video to use the codes will be uploaded after the acceptance of the manuscript.
